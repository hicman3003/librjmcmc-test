     *
     * This class is a model of the Acceptance concept and implements <i>Tsallis</i> acceptance rule. This is part of family of rules that occasionally accept large moves in energy, moves driven by a parameter \f$q\f$.
     * \f[
     * P_{Tsallis} = \left\{
     *                      \begin{array}{ll}
     *                          1 & \texttt{if } \Delta E\leq 0 \\
     *                          \left(1-\left(1-q\right)\frac{\Delta E}{T}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-q}} & \texttt{if } \Delta E> 0 \texttt{ and } \left(1-q\right)\frac{\Delta E}{T}\leq 1 \\
     *                          0 & \texttt{if } \Delta E> 0 \texttt{ and } \left(1-q\right)\frac{\Delta E}{T}>1 \\
     *                      \end{array}
     *               \right.
     * \f]
     * When \f$q\f$ tends to 1, <i>Tsallis</i> acceptance rule is equivalent to <i>Metropolis</i> acceptance rule. The final solution seems to be independant of \f$q\f$, but is reached quicker while decreasing \f$q\f$.
